To start the program named Snake v0.6, which is hosted on GitHub, follow these steps:

    Clone the repository to your local machine using the URL from GitHub:

    text
    git clone https://github.com/EtLasso/Snake.git

    Open the project folder in a suitable IDE like Visual Studio, since the project contains C# code (e.g., with files like Program.cs, Form1.cs, and related MVC folders).

    Restore any dependencies/packages if needed (e.g., using NuGet package manager in Visual Studio).

    Build the solution to compile the code.

    Run the program from the IDE (e.g., press F5 in Visual Studio) to start the Snake game.

This project uses the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern with clear separation into Controllers, Models, and Views folders. The main game logic and interface are managed across these components, with game state handling and user input configured for a typical Windows Forms Application environment.

In summary, the steps to start Snake are:

    Clone the repo

    Open in Visual Studio

    Build the solution

    Run the application

This will launch the game window where you can play Snake.
